              Get end-to-end through hole PCB assembly (THA) from prototypes to production. At Technotronix, we are committed to delivery of high-end technology solutions. To this end, we offer a complete range of through hole PCB assembly capabilities resulting in PCBs that are in compliance with international quality standards.
            </p>
            <p class="para-spacing my-4">
              Our through hole PCB Assembly services comprise of both manual and automated techniques. While our manual techniques can handle complex assemblies, the automated ones are best suited for small-volume production as also reduced material handling. We provide through hole PCB assembly at the highest quality level and in a cost-effective manner.

              </p>
  
              <ul class="list-content mx-3 my-3">
                <li>Withstanding stress: As opposed to SMT components, through-hole components are known for their ability to withstand mechanical and environmental stress.</li>
                <li>Perfect for large components Through-hole works well for large components that have to undergo high power and high voltage</li>
                <li>High heat tolerance Known for their high heat tolerance, they find application in a number of industries, particularly military and aerospace.</li>
                <li>Ease of Prototyping Through-hole PCBs also lend themselves to ease of prototyping and improved reliability</li>
                <li>High Reliability Through-hole PCBs are best used for high-reliability products that require stronger connections between layers.</li>
              </ul>
  
              <p class="para-spacing">
                Little surprise then, that even though surface mount components allow for denser configurations, for larger and heavier components that require strong bonds, through-hole technology has remained resilient and relevant.
